**TowerOS** is a high-assurance operating system for paranoid individuals and high-value targets. TowerOS has an unusual architecture: it combines *multiple, independent computers* into a single virtual system with a composited user interface. Each security domain is regelated to a separate *host* (e.g. a Raspberry Pi), and the user runs their applications from a *thin client* (e.g. a laptop) over a LAN using standard network protocols (SSH and NX). It's sort of like [Qubes OS](https://qubes-os.org], but inside-out---instead of dividing a single computer up into multiple security domains at the level of the hypervisor, TowerOS combines multiple computers together with the smallest trusted computing base possible while still providing a user-friendly system. For more information, please refer to the **[official project documentation](https://towercomputers.github.io/toweros/)**.
